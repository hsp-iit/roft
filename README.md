## Reproducing the experiments

We support running the experiments on the [FastYCB](https://github.com/hsp-iit/fast-ycb) dataset via the provided Docker image.

1. Pull the docker image:
    ```console
    docker pull ghcr.io/hsp-iit/roft:latest
    ```
1. Launch the container:
    ```console
    docker run -it --rm --user user --env="DISPLAY" --net=host --device /dev/dri/ ghcr.io/hsp-iit/roft:latest
    ```
1. Update and build the project:
    ```console
    cd /home/user/roft
    git pull
    cd build
    make install
    ```
1. Download and extract the accompanying data (FastYCB dataset and pre-evaluated results):
    ```console
    cd /home/user/roft
    bash tools/download/download_results.sh
    bash tools/download/download_fastycb.sh
    ```
1. Run the experiments (optional):
    ```console
    cd /home/user/roft
    bash test/run_paper_experiments
    ```
    > The accompanying data contains the pre-evaluated results. If desired, the results can be re-evaluated using the above command.
1. Run the evaluation:
    ```console
    cd /home/user/roft
    bash evaluation/run_paper_evaluation
    ```
1. Visualize the results:
    The results on the FastYCB dataset (Table I, II, IV and Figure 3) can be found in `/home/user/roft/evaluation_output`:
    - `tableI.pdf`
    - `tableII.pdf`
    - `tableIV.pdf`
    - `Fig3_*.png`

    The docker image provides `evince` and `eog` in order open pdf and png files, respectively.

> In order to run part of the provided software it could be required to temporarily execute `xhost +` in a console outside of Docker in order to allow the container accessing the X server facilities. The command can be run even **after** the container has been already launched.

> If you want to install the repository manually, please refer to the recipe contained in the [**`Dockerfile`**](./dockerfiles/Dockerfile). Please be aware that the results might differ if unsupported versions of the dependencies are used.

> Support for reproducing the experiments on the HO-3D dataset will be added in the near future.

> Instructions on how to use the ROFT library in external C++ projects and how to execute ROFT on custom datasets will be added in the near future.
